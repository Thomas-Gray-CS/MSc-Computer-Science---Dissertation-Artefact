## Teacher Data and Revision Tool

This is an application that I have made as part of a MSc Computer Science final project. 
This application meets the requirements of the research project, as well as the accreditation 
guidance from the British Computer Society.

## Disclaimers

Many of the files and lines of code within this project were written using online guides, information
from forums, instructional videos and information provided the network attached to each part of the 
files. Despite this, no blocks of code have been copied from anywhere else.

A full list of all sources used during the development of this artefact is included in the main project
bibliography.

## Operation of the Application

The application contains three key components which work together to create a fully functioning application, 
these being the frontend (created within the React JS Framework), the backend (created with Python Django)
and a SQLite database.

The application is intended to be a prototype proof of concept, and is not intended for public deployment.

To access the application, both the React and Django servers should be run. In order to do this, the following
should be used within the terminal:

React - npm start
Django - Python manage.py runserver

The terminal will display which ports the application is running on locally. This will allow for access to the
application.
